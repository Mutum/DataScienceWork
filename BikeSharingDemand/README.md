## [Bike Sharing Demand](https://github.com/ayushoriginal/DataScienceWork/tree/master/BikeSharingDemand)
### AIM: Forecast use of a city bikeshare system

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

The goal of this challenge is to build a model that predicts the count of bike shared, exclusively based on contextual features. The first part of this challenge was aimed to understand, to analyse and to process those dataset. I wanted to produce meaningful information with plots. The second part was to build a model and use a Machine Learning library in order to predict the count.

The more importants parameters were the time, the month, the temperature and the weather.  
Multiple models were tested during this challenge (Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, SVR and Random Forest). Finally, the chosen model was Random Forest. The accuracy was measured with [Out-of-Bag Error](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/OOBestimation.pdf) and the OOB score was 0.85.

The results on implementing several models is shown-

### Linear Model

Predicting using the attributes from testing dataset and plot them against the true values shows that the simple linear model is limited and cannot explain most of the variation in the response variable.

### Generalized Linear Model

Predicting using the attributes from testing dataset and plot them against the true values shows that the generalized linear model is significantly more accurate in predicting the variations in the response variable.

### Generalized Addictive Model

Here, I only used the third generalized addictive model in predicting. The plot shows that the spread of the response variables is similar to generalized linear model. This is understandable since the goodness of fit only improved by about 1%.

It is important to note that none of the statistical models has predicted the trend of the bike sharing rental count. This is due to the fact that the dataset does not contain relative predictor variables that can explain the seasonality, plus, I cannot simply transform the dataset and remove the trend without proper information allowing me to.
